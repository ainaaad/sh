NOTE: If the command we want to create is simple and without much complication we can create it with an alias (in Ubuntu):
  - sudo nano ~/.bashrc (It will open in the terminal a file to modify)
  - custom command_alias = »original command» (Insert an alias)
  - source ~/.bashrc (Activate changes)



# GITHUB.SH

It allows us to quickly make the following orders:
  - git status (and decide whether to abort or follow)
  - git add.
  - git commit -m <msg>
  - git push
 
 Note: The <msg> was indicated with the command. You can include your commit-msg next to github.sh with double commas.
